# Local External Dependencies

Sometimes public repositories can't readily be used as git submodules. Files may need to be moved around or modified in order to build them (correct relative paths used with #include for example). Even when that is not the case, a submodule can be overkill depending on its size and how much is used from it. All external code that came from other sources because of these issues is put here.
